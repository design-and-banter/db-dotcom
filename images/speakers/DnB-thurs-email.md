So two speakers down, and one to go! We will be introducing our third speaker, Nick Marsh, on Sunday so stay tuned.

In case you missed the last email, don't forget Design+Banter #3 is happening this Monday at the wonderful Bloomsbury Bowling Lanes. We will be kicking things off from 7:00pm, so arrive promptly and bag yourself a beer.

Thanks again to the guys at Pivotal Labs for sponsoring the event.

Have a great weekend, and I will see you on Monday.

Sam.



Design+Banter #3 is just around the corner, and we are getting pretty excited about this months speakers.

But we want you to be excited too! So we thought it would be cool to give you a quick introduction to each of our 3 speakers between now and Monday, to get you in the mood.

The other 2 speakers are Nick Marsh and Stuart Neale, and we will be doing a little intro to them too over the weekend. If you literally can't wait, head over to the site for there bios and Twitter handles.

So once again we will kick the evening off at 7:00pm, with a few cold ones waiting for you when you arrive. Get yourself there promptly, grab a beer and prepare yourself for what looks like three more, excellent talks.

Once we are done with the talks - you guessed it - we will be getting our bowl on once more. Don't worry if bowling isn't your thing, we also have arcade machines, table tennis, pool, oh yeah, and a room full of white hot designers.

We can't wait to see you all there.

Thanks,

Sam.

Hey there!

Just wanted to give you guys a quick heads up about the next Design and Banter meet-up on Monday (7:00pm), and remind you of the awesome talks and activities we have lined up (not too mention free beer).

Once again we have three brilliant speakers who will be delivering lightning talks and taking questions from 7:30pm.
Find out who is speaking here!
Once the talks are finished we will begin all of the games, and give you guys a chance to meet people, learn stuff, make friends and get your bowl on.

Same as last time, the evening's festivities will kick off at 7:00pm. So get there promptly and grab a beer, then find a seat or engage in some preliminary mingling before the talks begin.
All the best,

Sam.
