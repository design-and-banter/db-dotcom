            <h2>About the night</h2>

        <p>
          The format of the night is simple: there will be three talks of seven minutes each. What we are aiming for is a mixture of talks: some explaining a concept, some a technique or skill and some show’n’tells.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each talk will contain at least 2 minutes for questions and feedback. Questions and critique are encouraged. Once the talks are finished we'll start the beers and bowling.</p>
