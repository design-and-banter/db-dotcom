        <p class="sponsor">Conjure is a tool that drastically simplifys the design feedback process, by taking the feedback out of emails, phone calls (or snailmail?) and putting it where it belongs - on the design itself. Use it with any design - websites, apps, banners, tshirts. It's the most productive way to present designs, gather feedback, and get Sign off.</p>

            <h2>The full run-down</h2>

        <p>
          The format of the night is simple. Everyone arrives at 7:00pm for free beers and to get to know each other before the talks start. 
        </p>
        <p>There are three talks of seven minutes each and we aim for a mixture of topics &mdash; some explaining a concept, some a technique or skill and some "war stories".
        </p>

        <p>
          Each talk is then followed by a Q&amp;A session with the speaker. Once the talks are finished the beers continue and the bowling gets going. At some point late in the night we all go home.</p>
